Read in the data:

```{r}
Credit <- read.csv("http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv")
Credit$Utilization <- Credit$Balance / (Credit$Income*100)
DT::datatable(Credit[, -1], rownames = FALSE)
```


```{r}
library(MASS)
mod.fs <- stepAIC(lm(Rating ~ 1, data = Credit), scope = .~Income + Limit + Cards + Age + Education + Gender + Student + Married + Ethnicity + Balance + Utilization, direction = "forward", test = "F")
mod.be <- stepAIC(lm(Rating ~ Income + Limit + Cards + Age + Education + Gender + Student + Married + Ethnicity + Balance + Utilization, data = Credit), direction = "backward", test = "F")
summary(mod.fs)
summary(mod.be) 
car::vif(mod.be)
car::vif(mod.fs)
```

I prefer `mod.fs` since it has less multicollinearity.

* Create another model that predicts rating with `Limit`, `Cards`, `Married`, `Student`, and `Education` as features. 

```{r}
mod <- lm(Rating ~ Limit + Cards + Married + Student + Education, data = Credit)
summary(mod)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(mod)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
car::residualPlots(mod)
modN <- lm(Rating ~ poly(Limit, 2, raw = TRUE) + poly(Cards, 2, raw = TRUE) + Married + Student + Education, data = Credit)
summary(modN)
car::residualPlots(modN)
car::vif(modN)
summary(modN)
```

* Use your model to predict the `Rating` for an individual that has a credit card limit of
$6,000, has 4 credit cards, is married, and is not a student, and has an undergraduate degree (`Education` = 16).

* Use your model to predict the `Rating` for an individual that has a credit card limit of
$12,000, has 2 credit cards, is married, is not a student, and has an eighth grade education (`Education` = 8).

```{r}
predict(modN, newdata = data.frame(Limit = 6000, Cards = 4, Married = "Yes", Student = "No", Education = 16), response = "pred")
### Should be the same as:
coef(modN)[1] + coef(modN)[2]*6000 + coef(modN)[3]*6000^2 + coef(modN)[4]*4 + coef(modN)[5]*4^2 + coef(modN)[6]*1 + coef(modN)[7]*0 + coef(modN)[8]*16
predict(modN, newdata = data.frame(Limit = 12000, Cards = 2, Married = "Yes", Student = "No", Education = 8), response = "pred")
```
